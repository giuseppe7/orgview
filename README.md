## Environment Setup

Use the following to prepare your local environment.

1. Ensure you have the latest `pip` installed.  
   ```python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip```
1. Install `virtualenv` to avoid installing anything globally that may disrupt your other applications.  
   ```python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv```
1. Run `pip` with the requirements file to locally install necessary modules.  
   ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
1. Profit!

## Contributions

Basic unit tests required. Currently linting is only done with `flake8`.
